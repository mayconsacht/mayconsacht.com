          Besides technology, which I&apos;ve been passionate about since I
          first saw a computer, I also view surfing as both therapy & a
          philosophy of life. Like technology, anyone who surfs will agree that
          it&apos;s a school for life, requiring continuous learning & practice.
          No matter how much you do, there will always be room for improvement.

          I also enjoy taking amateur photos with my iPhone. They&apos;re not
          professional or spectacular, but if you&apos;d like, you can take a

          I started my Bachelor&apos;s degree in Information Systems in 2012,

          It&apos;s been a long time since I&apos;m thinking about creating a
          personal website to serve as a blog for sharing posts about technology
          & my life. My decision here was to &apos;keep it simple&apos;, a
          principle famously articulated by{' '}

            Inconsolata

          font. I&apos;ve always liked this font for codingâ€”it&apos;s a
          monospace that&apos;s easy to read. Just as architectural decisions
          can limit the design of an application, choosing Inconsolata almost
          forced me to develop a really square, retro-style layout & I ended up
          really liking it!
